# Introduction to AI


Learning outcome:

-   Conceptual understanding
-   Basic understanding of what AI is/isn't

Keywords:

AI, data, training data, machine learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, algorithm, neural network, autonomy, adaptivity, GAN, LLM

Information about the module:

This module is intended to be completed in two stages. The participants must first prepare individually (1 h) and then participate in a joint physical meeting with the other participants (1 h). Make sure that materials and questions for the preparation are available to the participants during the preparation time. The joint meeting is led by a facilitator. At that time, the participants need to have access to some digital device (computer, mobile, etc.) Total time required for both preparation and implementation is supposed to be 2 hours.

**Experience/Inspiration (45 min):**

All participants watch this film (subtitles in English are available):

Introduction to AI by Jonas Ivarsson (2019)

Make sure the list of key concepts is available to participants as a PDF.

.

**Individual reflection (15 min):**

-   Do you know of any technical solutions today that use AI to work?
-   Consider whether there is something you use in your everyday life and/or in your work life that uses AI to function.
-   Study the list of key concepts. Are any of the words completely new to you? In which contexts do you think the different types of machine learning can be used?

----------

_Joint physical meeting all participants + facilitator (1 h)._

**Practical work (40 min):**

_Recommended to be carried out in smaller groups of 3–4 participants. The facilitator moves between the groups and makes sure everyone gets started._

1. Do an image search on the internet for the words “Artificial Intelligence” and look at the results. Write down five words that you think describe the images that appear.
2. List three examples of areas where you think AI would be of good use as a tool and explain why. Then list three examples of problems that you think we either couldn't or simply shouldn't solve using AI and explain why.
3. Do an internet search on the word machine learning followed by your own research areas/fields. (For example: machine learning sociology). Do you find any interesting application for machine learning and if so, can you read what type of machine learning was used? How can machine learning be helpful in your research areas or the areas you teach? Discuss within the group.
4. Discuss with each other in the group. What do you think is important for your students to learn, related to both AI as a technology and the area you teach? What perspectives need to be considered to prepare students for their future profession or research?


**Joint reflection/discussion (20 min):**

_Suggested to be carried out in slightly larger groups where several of the smaller groups have been combined, alternatively with all participants. The facilitator directs the conversation._

-   Do the images that appear in an image search on "Artificial intelligence" give you a representative picture of what AI is? Why/why not?
-   Compare your lists with each other. Discuss what AI should be used for and if there are areas where we should avoid using AI?
-   Reflect on your machine learning search results. In which areas can machine learning be used? Are there any unexpected uses in your opinion? How general does Artificial Intelligence have to be to be useful?
-   Does everyone have to know something about AI? Is it important? Why/why not? Is it not enough that the programmer understands how these systems work?

## Key Concepts:

**AI**  – Artificial Intelligence. Lacks one commonly agreed upon definition but refers to software that is autonomous and adaptive to some extent.

**Autonomy**  – The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by the user.

**Adaptivity**  – The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.

**Data**  – Information that is registered somewhere.

**Algorithm**  – A sequence of instructions. Roughly like a recipe for baking.

**Model** - The part of the software that is used to solve the problem, for example make a prediction.

**Training data**  – Data provided for training the model in machine learning.

**Machine learning**  – An important subfield within AI. Systems that get better at a given task as the amount of experience and data increases. It is divided into the following three main areas:

**Supervised learning**  – During the learning process providing the model with the “correct answer” along with the corresponding data.

**Unsupervised learning**  – Means that during learning the model works without a “correct answer”, i.e., that the machine and algorithm tries to find structure in the data on its own.

**Reinforcement learning**  – Involves one or more algorithms learning the correct solution by trial and error and reinforcing behaviours that lead to positive outcomes, while the software weakens behaviours that lead to negative outcomes.

**Neural Network**  – A tool for solving machine learning problems. It is a structure for training a model that is loosely based on the biological neural networks found in our brains.

**Deep learning**  – An important subfield of machine learning. In deep learning, there is a neural network containing many layers of neurons (non-deep learning involves neural networks with only one or a small number of layers of neurons).

**GAN**  – Short for Generative Adversarial Networks. A type of machine learning where two neural networks compete against each other. One network is trained to create "fake" data based on the training data and the other network is trained to determine what in a data set is "fake" and what is "genuine". Each of the networks is forced to become better in this competition as the other network gets better.

**LLM**  – Short for Large Language Models. Very large neural networks trained on large amounts of text. A ready-made language model takes a text as input and repeatedly tries to predict the next word, producing a text as output. GPT-3 and GPT-4 on which different versions of ChatGPT are based are examples of large language models.

**Generative AI**  - AI that can generate data: text, images, film and music.
