# WASP-ED
## Resources for developing competence training for university lecturers (without specialized knowledge in AI)

**[Module 1: Introduction to AI](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul1.en.md)**

**[Module 2: Practical activities](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul2.en.md)**

**[Module 3: Ethics, opportunities and risks](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul3.en.md)**

**[Module 4: Generative AI and Learning Analytics in education](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul4.en.md)**

**[Module 5: AI in one's own subject area and teaching practice](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul5.en.md)**

The target group for the modules is teachers in higher education, and they are intended to be used by teachers themselves as a basis for competence development within their own workgroup, or by educational developers as material for competence development workshops or higher education pedagogy courses for teachers. The modules can be used in their entirety or in parts, or alternatively as inspiration to create your own material.

The instructions in the modules are written for the facilitator who will lead the delivery of the module. The facilitator needs to consider which parts of the material should be made available to the participants as preparation in advance and which parts should perhaps only be revealed to the participants during the group session. The facilitator is responsible for distributing both the preparatory material and the instructions to the participants.

To integrate the content into your universityâ€™s platform, such as Canvas, the simplest approach is to select the desired content, copy it, and paste it directly onto a content page within the platform. Links, formatting, and other elements should transfer seamlessly.

If you'd like to contribute to the development of the modules, this can easily be done via GitHub. After creating an account, you create a Fork of the repository. This creates a personal copy that you can edit and revise in your own environment without affecting the original version. Once you've made changes, you can propose integrating them into the original material. This structured process enables us to collaboratively enhance the modules and keep them up-to-date. Information about creating a Fork and submitting suggestions for changes will be presented on this page soon.
